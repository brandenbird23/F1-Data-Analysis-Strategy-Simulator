# Python Application For Various Formula 1 Analysis

* To run the project you must install the FastF1 python library *
* In the terminal, simply run "pip install fastf1 *
* After this run the program normally through main.py *


This project is a Formula 1 Data Analysis and Strategy Simulator.

Using the FastF1 python library package, users are able to retrieve 
the race data from all Formula 1 races from 2018-2023. It provides 
thorough results for each driver, giving the user valuable information 
needed to codnuct analysis on each race.

The project also includes a simulator that allows the user to pick a 
driver of their choosing over a specific race between 2018-2023, 
and change the race strategy for this driver. This includes changing 
tyre compound strategies and laps to pit on. The simulator will provide 
a detailed comparison of the real race results vs. the user built strategy 
results.
